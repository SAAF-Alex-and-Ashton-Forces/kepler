# Kepler

> “I much prefer the sharpest criticism of a single intelligent man to the thoughtless approval of the masses.”

The journey begins.

## Description

Kepler is a stargazing tool—not for those lovely celestial orbs of light, but for your stars you make on GitHub and GitLab.

GitHub stars are great—they let you bookmark interesting projects to view later. What is *not* great is GitHub's interface for managing your stars. If you're anything like [alex0112](https://github.com/alex0112), sorting through your 1k+ stars is, well, impossible on GitHub. This project aims to be a better star maanager.
