 # Kepler

> “I much prefer the sharpest criticism of a single intelligent man to the thoughtless approval of the masses.”

The journey begins.

## Description

Kepler is a stargazing tool—not for those lovely celestial orbs of light, but for your stars on GitHub, GitLab, and beyond.

GitHub stars are great-- they let you bookmark interesting projects to view later. What is *not* great is GitHub's interface for managing your stars. If you're anything like [alex0112](https://github.com/alex0112), sorting through your 1k+ stars is, well, impossible on GitHub. This project aims to be a better way to manage your stars so you can keep up on all your favorite projects.
