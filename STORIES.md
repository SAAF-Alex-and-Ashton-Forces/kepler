## User stories, use cases, and wild pipe dreams go here

Every time you do something on github and think, man I wish that I could do x with my stars, write it here:

- I remember a project I saw a long time ago and now I want to use it. It's a project written in language x/framework y.
- We should combine github and gitlab contributions in one commit graph, and we should consider adding other types of activity and making it more visually appealing/interactive.
- This app should have easter eggs. All the favorite nerd culture refs we love. Starvalanche. Starnado. Reponsoon. [All the great natural disasters are
included](https://youtu.be/MujQp2NKl5U)
- If we ever decide to go the federation route, I think it would be interesting to write the ability to add some specific tag or piece of data to a readme that indicates the federated network should crawl and display it.
- Once again, on the note of federation we'll probably have to write some sort of bridge to github/gitlab etc. to turn the activity feeds into a consistent format like RSS or ActivityPub
