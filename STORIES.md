## User stories and use cases go here

Every time you do something on github and think, man I wish that I could do x with my stars, write it here:

- I remember a project I saw a long time ago and now I want to use it. It's a project written in language x/framework y.
- We should combine github and gitlab contributions in one commit graph, and we should consider adding other types of activity and making it more visually appealing/interactive.
- This app should have easter eggs. All the favorite nerd culture refs we love. Starvalanche. Starnado. Reponsoon. [All the great natural disasters are included](https://youtu.be/MujQp2NKl5U)
